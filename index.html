        <font face="verdana" color="green">I adopted Patch from the Athens Area Humane Society in December 2015. He had a sister who had surrendered with him and she had already been adopted leaving Patch behind. He went through a series of foster homes until we rescued him. He has struggled with separation anxiety since he was a tiny pup. He loves his home and wouldn't trade cuddles on the couch for the world.</font>

    <font face="verdana" color="green">My family adopted Skip from the Oconee Regional Humane Society in October 2008. He was also the last one left of all his siblings. Skip has a high energy level and a fiesty attitude. He's the greatest and littlest protector of the household. He loves his rope and dislikes being left out if we don't share our snacks.</font>

    <font face="verdana" color="green">My sister adopted Zeus from the same animal shelter that Patch came from. He was only 8 weeks old and had 11 other brothers and sisters. He's not too big but has a bold personality. He tries to run the house and be alpha. He is corrected by our eldest dog, Casey, who happens to be the Queen.</font>

    <font face="verdana" color="green">My family adopted Casey when she was a year old from Madison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter in 2006. She was a rescue dog from Hurricane Katrina. We had to go through multiple treatments for heart worms after adopting her. She is now old, but still healthy! Her age hasn't stopped her from stealing table scraps yet.</font>
